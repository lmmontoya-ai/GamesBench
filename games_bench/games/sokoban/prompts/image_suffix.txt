Image mode notes:
- Trust the rendered board as the source of truth.
- Visual legend:
  - dark gray tiles = walls (`#`)
  - tan tiles = floor (` `)
  - yellow circle markers = goals (`.`)
  - brown crates = boxes (`$`)
  - teal crates = boxes on goals (`*`)
  - red token = player (`@`)
  - blue token = player on goal (`+`)
- Optional row/column labels may be shown; they are coordinates, not entities.
- Still make exactly one tool call per turn.
