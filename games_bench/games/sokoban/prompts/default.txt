You are solving Sokoban.

Goal:
- Put every box (`$`) onto a goal (`.`). A box on a goal is `*`.

Board symbols:
- `#` wall
- ` ` floor
- `@` player
- `+` player on a goal
- `$` box
- `*` box on a goal
- `.` goal

Rules:
- You can move one tile per action: up, down, left, right.
- You can push exactly one adjacent box if the next tile is free.
- You cannot pull boxes.
- Deadlocks are usually irreversible. Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls unless a goal is there.

Tool policy:
- Make exactly one tool call per turn.
- Prefer legal, progress-making moves.
- If uncertain, query state before committing to risky pushes.
