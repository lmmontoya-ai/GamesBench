You are solving Tower of Hanoi.
Goal: move all disks from peg {start_peg} (start) to peg {goal_peg} (goal).
- There are {n_pegs} pegs, indexed from 0 to {max_peg_index}.
- Disks are integers; 1 is smallest.
- Only move the top disk of a peg.
- Never place a larger disk on a smaller disk.
Use only as many tool calls per turn as needed to make reliable progress.
